# Tables — source notebooks

These tables are used in the paper. Each is generated by a notebook under `5_results_analysis/notebooks/`.

| Paper | Table file | Source notebook |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Table 2 | `table2_descriptive_statistics.tex`, `table2_descriptive_statistics.csv` | `notebooks/Descriptive_Statistics.ipynb` |
| Tables 3, 4, 5 | `table3_4_5_statistics.tex` | `notebooks/Structural_Groups_Analysis.ipynb` |

*(Table 1 in the paper is the topology summary and is written inline; it is not generated by these notebooks.)*

To regenerate: run the notebooks from `5_results_analysis/` (see `5_results_analysis/README.md`). Input: `5_results_data/run_table.csv` at repo root.
