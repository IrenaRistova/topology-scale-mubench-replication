# Section 5: Results analysis

Scripts that **directly produce** the figures and tables used in the paper. This directory corresponds to **Section 5** (Results and Analysis — scripts and outputs) of the paper.

**Paper section:** Section 5.

## Outputs

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `figures/boxplot_energy_by_topology.pdf` | Energy by topology (boxplot) |
| `figures/boxplot_metrics_by_size_combined.pdf` | Throughput, latency, energy, CPU, memory by system size (combined) |
| `figures/boxplot_metrics_by_topology_and_size_combined.pdf` | Throughput, latency, energy by topology and system size (combined) |
| `tables/descriptive_stats.tex` | Descriptive statistics table (LaTeX) |
| `tables/descriptive_stats.csv` | Same, CSV |
| `tables/statistical_tests.tex` | Statistical test results (LaTeX) |
| `tables/statistical_tests.csv` | Same, CSV |

**Note:** `figures/expflow.pdf` (experiment workflow diagram) is a static asset, not generated by this script; it is included in this replication package.

## How to run

From the **replication package root** (`topology-scale-mubench-replication/`):

```bash
pip install -r 5_results_analysis/requirements.txt
python3 5_results_analysis/make_results.py
```

Or from this directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 make_results.py
```

**Input:** `5_results_data/run_table.csv` (one row per run/repetition; only rows with `__done == DONE` are used).

**Outputs:** Written to `5_results_analysis/figures/` and `5_results_analysis/tables/`.
